# siteMapper
1. Visits the root page of a given website and makes a list of every link on that page that goes to a page on the same domain. 
2. Creates a list of links using recursion to visit every page on a given domain that is reachable from the root page.
3. Outputs data into CLI


# Todo
1. Output into an XML file instead of ClI


# Thanks
Jon Calhoun and Jean, without who this wouldn't be possible!
